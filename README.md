# hello-world
Well, here goes nothing....

I started learning HTML right around the time the internet was still in just a few households. My grandfather had a book called HTML for dummies, and I was curious about it. I'd already played a bit on the internet (think WBS.net days if you remember that), and thought 'what the hell I think this might be cool to do'.

I began my learning journey and had wrote a few pages to play around with. Over time and through my teen years in the mid-late nineties I had created quite a few fun GeoCities websites. By 15 I had one dedicated to HIV education and awareness, inspired by my cousin who had it. It even won an award (though from an affiliate type site - it felt good!). I created a basic website for a friend's car dealership as well by the age of 18 and that was my first paid html job. 

Fast forward to now, and I have gotten away from the whole code world which would have fascinated my so much in my pre-teen and teen years. My passion for it was always there but my job and school and moving into 'adulthood' took my attention elsewhere. I work in hospitality management now (right? night and day). I recently decided to pick up a hobby to keep my brain entertained but also one that would be fun and challenging. So, here I am. 

So far I am having to learn just about from scratch. I still have a good understanding of HTML, but obviously that is not the only thing you need to have now to program a website, by today's standards. I've been doing tutorials on PHP & CSS. JavaScript and AJAX are on my radar too. I can't really make anything spectacular yet, but I have had so much fun this past month, and now I have decided to create an account here to network and learn more. 

My goal is to eventually turn my hobby into my 'retirement' career (I am 35 now and want to 'retire' by 40). In other words, I just want to change careers and retire my current one. I'd imagine once I am more comforable and confident in my coding that I will be bringing some little projects here that I want to create for the things I do. That said, feel free to share ideas on where to start, data modeling, code, and whatever else you think could help! 

My first will be a simple bill and balance tracker. Keep an eye out for the 'project' and I look forward to learning from the community and eventually contributing once I know I won't rip the space time continuum in your code. 

All the Best,

A
